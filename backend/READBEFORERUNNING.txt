Setting up virtual environment, you dont have to do this but I mean why not 
python3 -m venv path/to/venv

ACTIVATION 
source path/to/venv/bin/activate

then install the requirenments by 
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

In order to run project, u have to open one terminal go to backend folder and run python3 app.py. 
Then, split terminal and go to frontend and run npm start
